# Real Estate ML Project – 
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real estate data and predicting property prices using a *Linear Regression* machine learning model.

Objective
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real estate datasets.
- Build a linear regression model to predict property prices based on features like area, location, and amenities.
- Evaluate model performance and provide insights for price estimation.

Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: Load real estate dataset (CSV format).
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualize relationships between features and target variable (price).
4. *Model Building*: Implement Linear Regression to predict property prices.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Use metrics like *RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)*, *R² Score*, and residual analysis to assess performance.

Usage Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `real_estate_prediction.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells sequentially for data preprocessing, EDA, and model building.
3. Review the model performance metrics in the output or `model_evaluation.pdf`.

Key Features Used for Prediction
- *Area* (square feet)
- *Location* (categorical)
- *Number of bedrooms*
- *Age of property*
- *Amenities* (encoded)

Expected Outcomes
- Accurate property price predictions using linear regression.
- Insights into which features most influence real estate prices.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

If you need the *code* or *step-by-step implementation* details, please specify:
1. Programming language (Python/R).
2. Whether you want full notebook code or specific sections.
3. Desired output format (code snippets, PDF report).
